A total of 37 companies and joint ventures have applied to pre-qualify to participate in the privatization of three regional power distribution companies in Turkey, according to Turkey's privatization agency. Among the 37 companies that have applied are Enel, E.ON, Iberdrola, AES, and Suez-Tractebel, the agency said. Turkey plans to sell a 100% stake in the Sakarya, Anatolian Shore, and Capital distribution grids that run between the country's capital, Ankara, and the Asian coast of Istanbul. The privatization agency said that 28 companies applied to pre-qualify for the Istanbul grid, 24 for the Ankara grid, and 30 for the Sakarya grid that connects the two cities via north-western Turkey. Final bids for the distribution grids are now due by 19 January 2007, with Turkey planning to privatize the remainder of the country's 20 regional power grids at a later date.
