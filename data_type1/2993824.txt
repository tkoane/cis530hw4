News Corp Confident of Deal with Liberty.
News Corp Inc chairman Rupert Murdoch looks set to secure his family control of the group after giving his strongest indication yet that he can broker a peace deal with Liberty Media, The Australian Financial Review reported, citing Murdoch. In an interview with the newspaper, Murdoch said that the deal to remove Liberty Media from his company's share register might involve the sale to Liberty of about 6 of News Corp's 35 US television stations. "The conversations between us have become more substantial and I am hopeful of a resolution in the next few months," Murdoch told the newspaper. Liberty built an 18 percent holding in News Corp last year, which threatened to challenge the Murdoch family's control of the company. The Murdoch family controls just over 30 percent of News Corp's voting stock.
