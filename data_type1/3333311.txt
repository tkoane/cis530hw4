PTT Considers Takeover Of Jet Network.
PTT Plc is considering a plan to buy out the local network of Jet pump stations in a deal valued at over THB 3 billion. PTT president Prasert Bunsumpun said on November 28 that the company was studying details of purchasing ConocoPhillips' network of 147 Jet stations nationwide. We're looking at the valuations right now. Marketing margins for retail pumps are quite low, but Jet stations offer a variety of non-oil businesses as well that offer double-digit margins, Mr. Prasert said. We should conclude by January whether we will do the deal or not. PTT executives said the due diligence for the transaction had been completed, and that Jet's network offered little duplication with PTT's own 1,200 stations. Conoco announced earlier this year that it would divest its Thai stations after failing to break even in 15 years. Among the other companies that have expressed interest in buying the Jet network are Shell and Petronas.
