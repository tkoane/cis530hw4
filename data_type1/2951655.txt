China Mobile to Acquire Stake in Phoenix Satellite.
China Mobile Ltd is set to announce on June 8th that it will acquire 20 percent of Phoenix Satellite Television from News Corp in preparation for the launch of third-generation (3G) cell phone services, the South China Morning Post reported. China Mobile is expected to pay cash for the shares, valued at more than $1 billion. At present, News Corp has a 38 percent stake in Phoenix. In February, rumors began to circulate that Rupert Murdoch of News Corp intended to pull out of News Corp's joint venture with Phoenix because of the tight controls on the Chinese media market, the newspaper said. The sources reportedly said that having China Mobile as a partner in Phoenix TV could help News Corp's expansion in China -- assuming Murdoch has not given up hope of penetrating the Chinese market.
