Rupert Murdoch Might Offer Asset, Cash Deal to Liberty.
Rupert Murdoch appears close to settling a long-running dispute with John Malone in an asset and cash deal totaling $6.46 billion. Analysts said Mr. Murdoch might sell six U.S. TV stations to Mr. Malone's Liberty Media, and offer $4.81 billion in cash for Liberty's 190 million voting shares and 25 percent of its non-voting scrip in News Corp. Mr. Murdoch this week said negotiations with Mr. Malone have become ''more substantial'', according to a media report.
