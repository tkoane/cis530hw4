Second-Round Bids For Travel Channel Ahead Of Time.
Second-round bids for a majority stake in Travel Channel Media have come in significantly ahead of expectations with unanticipated private equity interest adding to demand from media companies, the Financial Times reported on September 2. The offers for the 65% stake put up for sale by Cox Communications, Inc. could value the channel at $800 million or more, the paper reported, citing three people familiar with the sales progress. Most analysts had expected Travel Channel to fetch around $600 million to $700 million. Scripps Networks Interactive Inc., touted as being favorite in the auction, and News Corp have both tabled bids along with three private equity groups, the FT said. Cox Communications was not immediately available for comment.
