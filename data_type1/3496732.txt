News Corp Rules Out Full BSkyB Takeover.
Rupert Murdoch has ruled out a News Corp takeover of British Sky Broadcasting PLC, claiming it would be 'too expensive', the MediaGuardian website has reported. Asked on a News Corp results conference call if he would like News Corp to buy out the 61% of BSkyB it does not own, he said it would cost too much, the paper said. 'There's rumors about this but as far as the UK and Sky (is concerned) we would love to, but it's just too expensive,' the News Corp chief and Sky chairman told analysts and reporters. 'It would cost us many, many billions of dollars.'
