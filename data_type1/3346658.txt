News Corp Not Bidding For Tribune Assets.
News Corp. is not bidding on any parts of Tribune Co., a senior News Corp. executive said on December 4th. "We're not bidding for any of the assets," News Corp Chief Operating Officer Peter Chernin told reporters at the UBS Media and Communications Conference in New York. The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported in November that News Corp. expressed interest in buying Newsday. Tribune is reviewing its options to boost its stock price, in a move to placate unhappy investors. The company has said that all options are open, which analysts said means that Tribune could sell individual assets or find a buyer for the entire company.
