Blinkx Rises On Bid Speculation.
Shares of Blinkx Plc surged 50% on talk that Google Inc and News Corp may bid for the firm. The speculation could have come in anticipation of a May 24 expiry of a clause which stipulates that $50 million should be paid to Autonomy in the event of a buyout within a year of Blinkxs initial share sale, IPO filings show. Another reason as told by Piper Jaffrays analyst Rajeev Bahl is that Blinkx may be a target because of its technology and its strong consumer focus. Officials of the companies were not immediately available for comment.
