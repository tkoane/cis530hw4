Fox Interactive In Talks To Buy Photobucket.
Fox Interactive Media, a division of News Corp is in advanced stages of negotiations to acquire Photobucket. A person familiar with the matter said that the deal is not yet complete, but the parties have ironed out major issues and are focusing on finer points. The price could be as high as $300 million. The person asked not to be further identified because of the sensitivity of the talks. Representatives of MySpace, Fox Interactive Media and Photobucket all declined to comment. News of the discussions was first reported earlier on a Silicon Valley blog, Valleywag. Photobucket said last month that it had hired Lehman Brothers to explore a possible sale of the company.
