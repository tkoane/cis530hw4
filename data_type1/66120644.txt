BTV Reportedly Considers Stake Sale.
Balkan News Corporation EAD (bTV) might be considering the sale of a 55% stake to Central European Media Enterprises Ltd., according to unofficial information. Rupert Murdoch, chief of News Corp, owner of bTV is reported to have nearly sealed the deal, whose price is believed to be about 500 million. The future acquisition of the remaining 45% stake in bTV has not been ruled out. It was reported that talks about the upcoming sale of bTV first emerged in July 2008. News Corp first hired Lehman Brothers to ascertain the value and strategic options for three Eastern European television stations, wholly owned properties in Latvia, Serbia and Bulgaria, after being approached by multiple suitors. It is believed that the properties were not doing poorly, but the company had decided to hire Lehman after the suitors' approaches. At least seven big suitors, including RTL, said they were considering buying the portfolio of bTV a year ago. Initially the price was set at 1.1 billion, but eventually shrank to 750 millio
