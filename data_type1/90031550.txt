News Corp Not Eyeing MGM, Miramax.
The CEO of News Corp., Rupert Murdoch, said on February 2 that he had a look at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., (MGM) and Miramax Films Corporation and is not interested, an opinion seconded by Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., which is facing bankruptcy and is up for sale by a group consisting of Sony Corp. and Comcast Corp. The studio is valued at around $2 billion. The Walt Disney Co.'s Miramax Films is also reportedly up for sale and has been estimated to be worth around $700 million. Rupert Murdoch said, "For film libraries, it's just a matter of opinion what they're worth. The bigger one, MGM, is for the most part very old. There are some good films in it. At the right price we'd be interested, but it appears that other people are more interested. So I think you can count us out of that one altogether. We don't know how that'll end up. And I can rule out Miramax right away."
