NuStar Energy L.P.s Chief Executive, Curtis Anastasio has said that the company most likely go on a buying spree in 2011 as larger oil and gas companies look to strip themselves of pipeline and terminal assets. Anastasio said that NuStar could take advantage of deals offered by such majors as Exxon Mobil Corporation, BP plc and ConocoPhillips and others look to raise money and concentrate on upstream business. He said, All the majors you can think of have started dribbling out packets of logistics assets. There's a high probability that we'll do an acquisition this year."
