News Corp To Buy Stake In Nimbus.
News Corp. is close to buying nearly a third of Nimbus Communications Ltd. for more than INR 4 billion ($86 million), the Economic Times reported on September 5. "Nimbus is expected to announce a massive distribution arrangement with Star shortly, which is being seen as a precursor to this deal," the newspaper said. A spokesman for Star India declined comment. A spokeswoman for Nimbus did not immediately return calls. Nimbus had last month said it would launch three India-focused sports channels later this year or early in 2007. Nimbus paid $612 million for the telecast rights to the Indian cricket board's matches for 2006-10. 3i, Deutsche Bank and Americorp Ventures hold stakes in Nimbus.
