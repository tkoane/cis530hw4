Talk Spreads Of PVH, Other Firms Buying Warnaco.
Speculation that Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. might take over Warnaco was heavy among the crowd gathered at a Las Vegas apparel show, according to a Lazard research note published on August 30 2006. Warnaco is under pressure from a shareholder to turn around the company, whose shares have dropped this year. Barington Capital Group LP, which owns 5.6 percent of Warnaco's shares, said on Aug. 21 it wanted to open talks with the company to discuss various initiatives, including the possibility of selling assets. "Speculation about a Phillips-Van Heusen purchase of WRNC (Warnaco) was everywhere," at the apparel show, Lazard analyst Todd Slater said in a research note. "We don't comment on rumor or speculation," said Warnaco spokeswoman Deborah Abraham. A representative from Phillips-Van Heusen was not immediately available to comment.
