News Corp Explores Swap MySpace And Yahoo.
It was reported that News Corporation has discussed swapping MySpace with Yahoo! in return for a 25% stake in the enlarged group. The discussions remain tentative and could fall apart after the Terry Semel left as Yahoo!s chief executive. Other News Corp digital assets, including IGN are also thought to have been offered to Yahoo!. It is not clear whether Yahoo! was willing to accept the terms offered, even though it has been eager to break into social networking to catch up with Google. Yahoo! tried and failed to buy Facebook, for $1 billion last year.
