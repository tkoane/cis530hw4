GS Caltex Eyes Hyundai Oilbank.
Goodmorning Shinhan Securities has said that GS Caltex Corp is actively eyeing the bidding process for the sale of International Petroleum Investment Cos (IPIC) stake in Hyundai Oilbank Corp. IPIC, which is expected to sell 35% of its 70% stake in, will shortlist about four potential buyers as early as this week, selecting from quite a few candidates that have expressed their interests. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co, GS Caltex, Lotte Group and ConocoPhillips are understood to be possible candidates to acquire the stake. A Hyundai Oilbank spokesman said he has no information on the sale process. We view GS Caltex as having a relatively active stance as the stake purchase will help it compete against larger refiners such as SK Energy Co Ltd and SK Incheon Oil, the company said in a research note.
