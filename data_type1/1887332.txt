Lukoil Confirms Interest In Buying Mazeikiai Nafta Stock.
Lukoil President Vagit Alekperov said his company is interested in buying stock of Lithuania's Mazeikiai Nafta after a meeting with Lithuanian Prime Minister Algirdas Brazauskas. He said they would like to buy the entire interest of Yukos (53.7%) and the Lithuanian government interest (40.66%). The only stumbling stone is the excessively high price of the stock, Alekperov said. Analysts say that the market price of the Yukos interest alone nears 1.4 billion euros ($1.69 billion). Lukoil said it to discuss the acquisition of Mazeikiai Nafta without knowing how the deal would be concluded and how much the shares would cost. The company said a possible way of the acquisition "is the involvement of ConocoPhillips, which owns 12.6% of Lukoil stock via intermediaries.
