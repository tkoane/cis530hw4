Calpine Gets Bids From Financial; Strategic Buyers.
Calpine Corp. has received bids from financial and strategic buyers including at least one bid for the entire company, according to sources familiar with the situation, in the latest sign of a revival in demand for power companies. The company, which listed more than $26 billion in assets when it filed for bankruptcy, invited bidders earlier this year to make offers for part or all of its equity as part of its bankruptcy process, and bids were due earlier this month, the sources said. It is still uncertain that the company will accept any of the offers as it weighs them as a possible way to emerge from bankruptcy. A Calpine spokesman declined to comment. The Carlyle Group was among the private equity firms looking at Calpine, a source familiar with the deal said, adding that Carlyle was teamed up with AES Corp. However, another source familiar with the situation said AES was not working with Carlyle. Sources said other private equity firms were also interested. Carlyle and AES both declined to comment.
