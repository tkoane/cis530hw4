News Corp. says Held Talks over PCCW Bid.
News Corp. said it held early talks to join a $7.3 billion bid led by Macquarie Bank Ltd. for the phone and media assets of Hong Kong's PCCW Ltd. But contrary to a published report from a News Corp.-owned newspaper, it has not yet joined the consortium, after being approached by Macquarie, the spokesman said. "We've had preliminary talks with Macquarie, but we have not taken any stake," a News Corp. spokesman said. The company's statement contradicts a report in The Australian newspaper that said News Corp. had taken a "modest" stake in the consortium of up to 20 percent. "It is believed that there is at least one other player in the Macquarie Bank consortium, in addition to News Corp.," the newspaper said.
