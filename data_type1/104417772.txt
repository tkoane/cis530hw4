McGraw-Hill Reportedly Drops Out Of IDCs Auction.
The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. might be dropping out of the auction for Interactive Data Corporation (IDC), sources briefed on the matter said. IDC has reportedly been through one round of bids. The deadline for the second round is set for April 28, and a number of private equity bidders remain in the auction, sources said. Some bidders are starting to feel the valuations are now too high, sources said. IDC shares were down 1.2% at $33.52 on following the news of McGraw-Hill dropping out. Reuters reported that McGraw-Hill and IDC declined to comment. Many private equity firms had formed consortiums to bid for IDC. Groups still in the running for the second round include Advent International S.r.l. with Bain Capital, LLC; Warburg Pincus LLC with Hellman & Friedman LLC and Silver Lake Partners; and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. with CVC Ltd., sources said. Reuters reported that all these firms either declined to comment or were unavailable for comment.
