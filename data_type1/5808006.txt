Murdoch Reportedly Eyes New York Times.
Rupert Murdoch is looking at acquiring a stake in New York Times and has evaluated acquiring a sizable minority stake in Bloomberg News, Vanity Fair's Michael Wolff reported.  It's obviously irresistible to him. I've watched him go through the numbers, plot out a merger with the Journal's backroom operations, and fantasize about the staff's quitting en masse as soon as he entered the sacred temple, Wolff wrote. News Corp was not immediately available to comment on the article.
