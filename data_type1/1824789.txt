Murdoch Sights More Internet Targets.
Rupert Murdoch has put two more internet companies on News Corporation's list of desired acquisitions: Blinkx and IGN Entertainment, people familiar with the company's plans said. The media conglomerate has already bought Scout Media, a sports web company, and Intermix, which operates social networking site My-Space.com. Talks to buy video search engine Blinkx are under way. IGN, a video gaming company considering an initial public offering or a sale, is also under consideration and could be valued at up to $800 million, people briefed on its plans said. Mr. Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corp, this year identified the internet as a priority and said the group could spend up to $2 billion on acquisitions.
