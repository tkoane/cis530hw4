News Corp in Final Stages of Talks to Buy Stake in TGRT.
News Corp.'s talks with Ihlas Holding to buy a stake in broadcaster TGRT are nearing the final stages, a source familiar with the parties said on July 12th. Ihlas, which owns a majority of TGRT, said in May it was in negotiations with a U.S.-based group over the broadcaster, but has declined to comment since. News Corp. wasn't immediately available to comment. "They are reaching toward the final stages but it's not there yet," the source said.
