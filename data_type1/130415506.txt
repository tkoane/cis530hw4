In the next two to three weeks, NextEra Energy Inc is likely to send out teasers for the sale of six gas-fired power plants for between $1.5 billion to $2 billion, FT.com reported. The plants that would be sold could include four combined cycle, one simple cycle and one other gas-fired power plant, including the Blythe Energy plant in California. The report stated that the company is known to have contacted at least one potential buyer for three gas-fired plants in Alabama, South Carolina and Virginia as well as the Blythe plant, a year ago, but no formal sale process was under way. As per the report, Citigroup and Credit Suisse are advising NextEra on the sale.
