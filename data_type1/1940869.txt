ConocoPhillips wants to buy Lithuania refinery in partnership with Lukoil.
US oil company ConocoPhillips is interested in buying Lithuanian oil refining company Mazeikiu Nafta in partnership with Russian oil giant Lukoil, according to ConocoPhillips chairman James Mulva. 'We are ready to commence negotiations,' Mulva said in Vilnius after meeting Lithuanian Economy Minister Kestutis Dauksys. 'If ownership in Mazeikiu Nafta is purchased it would be done 50-50 by Conoco-Phillips and Lukoil,' he added. Embattled Russian oil giant Yukos, which is locked in a financially crippling fight with the Russian government over back taxes, currently holds 53.7 pct of Mazeikiu Nafta and has management rights in the refinery. The Lithuanian government holds 40.6 pct in the refinery.
