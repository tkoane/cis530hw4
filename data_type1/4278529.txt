Eni Doubles Stake In Ceska Rafinerka.
Euro reported on its website that Eni SpA has bought a 16.33% stake in Ceska Rafinerka. The site quoted an unnamed source as saying ENI bought the stake from ConocoPhillips, doubling its interest in Ceska, 51% owned by Unipetrol. Unipetrol has itself long been interested in raising its stake by acquiring the shares offered by ConocoPhillips. Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore first reported last week that ENI may have raised its Rafinerska stake, but none of the parties involved have confirmed nor denied the deal since. ENI, Unipetrol and Rafinerska had no comment on the rumors of the sale and a ConocoPhillips spokesman in the Czech Republic could not be reached.
