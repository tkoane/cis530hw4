Macquarie Buys About 6.6% Stake In UTV.
Macquarie Bank has bought a stake of about 6.6% in UTV Software Communications over the past month for News Corp, said the Economic Times. The report quoted unnamed sources saying that Macquarie Bank would probably increase this stake to 14.99% before offloading it. The report added that once the bank buys about 14.99%, the open offer may lead to a bidding war with Walt Disney Company, which currently holds 14.99% in UTV. The report said both UTV and News Corp declined to comment, adding that News Corp sees UTV as its supply chain in India. It added that News Corp is also believed to have a 10-20% stake in the Macquarie Bank consortium.
