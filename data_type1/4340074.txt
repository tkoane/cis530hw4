Austar Says Talks With Foxtel Terminated; Still Talking To Other Parties.
Austar United Communications Ltd. said on June 1st that talks with Foxtel about a potential takeover offer have been terminated, but it remains in talks with other parties. In a brief statement, Austar said the discussions with other third parties are preliminary and incomplete. It did not say why the talks were terminated. The Australian Financial Review reported earlier on June 1st that Foxtel's 50% owner Telstra Corp. walked away from negotiations after telling other shareholders Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd. and News Corp. it would not pay the AUD 1.80 price tag Austar had already rejected. A Telstra spokesman declined to comment.
