Fluor Hires Consultant For British Nuclear Group Site.
Fluor, the US engineering company that is keen to buy British Nuclear Group (BNG), has hired the former boss of the Sellafield site as a consultant. Sellafield, in west Cumbria, is the largest nuclear site in the UK. Whoever buys BNG will receive a five-year contract to clean up its ageing reactors. Fluor confirmed that it had hired Brian Watson, who ran Sellafield for five years until he retired in 2004. A spokesman for Fluor said it believed Mr Watson would be able to help the company "get a better understanding of the Sellafield complex and help us grow across all of our businesses''.
