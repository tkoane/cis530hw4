Liberty Gets Sports Channels In News Corp Deal.
Liberty Media will regain ownership of regional sports cable channels in Pittsburgh, Seattle and its home market of Denver, in a deal expected to be announced this week with News Corp., the December 11ths Wall Street Journal reported, citing people close to the situation. With regional coverage of professional sports teams including the Pittsburgh Pirates, Seattle Mariners and Colorado Rockies, the networks are a small but vital piece of a much larger swap under discussion between the two companies, the paper said. News Corp. could finalize a deal as early as this week to swap its controlling interest in DirecTV Group Inc. and other assets for Liberty's $11 billion stake in News Corp., a source familiar with the matter told said on December 7th. News Corp and Liberty Media were not immediately available for comment.
