A Lyondell spokesman did not reply to phone messages and a Citgo spokesman declined to comment about on-going negotiations. Previously, the price tag for the refinery had been estimated to be between $4 billion and $5 billion. ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil Corp., Tesoro Corp., Husky Energy Inc. and Carlyle Group were said to be finalists for the refinery.
