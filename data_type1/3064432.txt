Polsat Denies Stake Sale to Bertelsmann.
Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, the owner of the Polish national commercial broadcaster Polsat, has denied a local newspaper report that Bertelsmann has acquired a 25 percent stake in the company. However, he has also confirmed that negotiations are ongoing with several parties and a buyer for a stake of 20-25 percent is likely to be chosen in the next three months. News Corp. is understood to be one of these parties, and the Rupert Murdoch-backed group, which is already present in Poland through TV Puls, has just acquired an unspecified stake in the Turkish broadcaster TGRT for $98 million.
