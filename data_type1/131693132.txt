Suitors Eye ConocoPhillips Germany Oil Refinery.
A group of investors including a Saudi Arabian trust is considering purchasing the Wilhelmshaven oil refinery in Germany put up for sale by ConocoPhillips, NDR reported. ConocoPhillips said in July, 2010 that it would either divest the refinery or will turn it into an oil distribution terminal as it wanted to cut downstream operations and output had been stopped. A consortium comprising of Hans van Weelden, Carsten Hippenstiel and a Saudi Arabian trust is bidding for the refinery, consortium spokesman Thomas Reiter told NDR. Reiter said that the trust is linked with the Saudi royal family. He added that the bank handling the refinery sale declined talks about the consortium's offer, Reiter said. The group is seeking further discussions, he told NDR.
