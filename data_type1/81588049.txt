Kinder Morgan Eyes ConocoPhillips Assets.
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP may plans to acquire some pipeline and terminal assets from ConocoPhillips or other major oil companies. Kimberly Dang, Chief Financial Officer of the firm said, I think there will be opportunities to invest in those. There is nothing definitive. In October, ConocoPhillips said it would sell about $10 billion of assets in the next two years. Bill Stephens, a ConocoPhillips spokesman, declined in an e-mail to comment on possible purchases of the companys assets by Kinder Morgan. Jeff Sheets, a senior vice president of planning and strategy, said this week that ConocoPhillips may look to sell interests in infrastructure assets such as a 25% stake in the Rockies Express pipeline.
