Cerberus Capital, Others Reportedly Eye Pacific Architects.
Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. is among the suitors for Lockheed Martin Corporation's Pacific Architects and Engineers Incorporated, which is being marketed for around $500 million, people familiar with the matter said. Cerberus is interested in Pacific Architects and Engineers because of the potential synergies between the firms, the people said. PAE had been put up for sale in June. It has also drawn interest from firms such as KBR, Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Fluor Corporation and URS Corporation, the sources said. Lockheed Martin hired Evercore to run the auction and is planning management meetings with the interested parties this week and wants to reach a deal by the end of this year, the people said. They asked not to be identified because details of the auction are not public. Reuters reported that representatives for Cerberus, Lockheed Martin, Evercore, KBR and URS declined to comment. Fluor and Jacobs Engineering were not available for comment.
