Marubeni, Fluor to Join Westinghouse Buyout.
The Nihon Keizai business daily reported that Marubeni Corp., Fluor Corp. and two others will take stakes in Toshiba Corp.'s $5.4 billion acquisition of Westinghouse. The paper said the companies, which also include Shaw Group Inc. and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., will invest a total of about 300 billion yen ($2.6 billion) in the buyout of the U.S. power plant arm of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. Toshiba, which will keep a roughly 51 percent stake, is asking Marubeni and Fluor to take stakes of about 20 percent each, while Shaw and IHI take stakes of about 5 percent each, the paper said, adding that more companies could join. A spokesman at Toshiba, which had said it was in talks with five or six companies about taking minority stakes in Westinghouse, said the company was still in talks with multiple candidates but declined to comment further.
