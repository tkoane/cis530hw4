News Corporation, Bertelsmann in Talks to Buy Stake in Polsat.
News Corporation Inc. and Bertelsmann are in talks to buy a minority stake in Polsat, Polish newspapers reported on July 20th. Quoting two independent unnamed sources, Dziennik daily reported that Bertelsmann may have signed a preliminary agreement to buy a 20 percent share in Polsat at a cost of 250 million euros ($315 million). Rival daily Gazeta Wyborcza said News Corp., run by Rupert Murdoch, was also in talks with the station. Polsat could not immediately be reached for comment. "I have signed no agreement though I do admit we are talking to Bertelsmann," Dziennik quoted Polsat owner Zbigniew Solorz as saying. "But we are also negotiating with other investors."
