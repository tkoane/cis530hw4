News Corp Raises Stake In UTV.
Companies acting on behalf of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp have bought 3.5-4% of UTV, in which Walt Disney Co holds a 15% stake, on the market, and News Corp plans to further increase its stake to near 15% and make an open offer for UTV, The Economic Times reported, citing sources. The report said News Corp was earlier this year in talks with the firm to take a stake, but talks broke down as News Corp did not want to own the Hungama television channel which at the time was a UTV unit. Following the end of talks with News Corp, Walt Disney in July bought a 15% stake in UTV for about $44.5 million.
