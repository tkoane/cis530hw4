Murdoch Prefers Sky Italia To Remain Independent.
Rupert Murdoch on September 19th said that News Corp. prefers to keep its Sky Italia satellite television service independent, but confirmed that the company has held talks with Telecom Italia. Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi last week said he had been told by Telecom Italia that it was prepared to sell News Corp. a stake in the company in exchange for Sky Italia. "We were in talks, we got into it," Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corp., told investors at a Goldman Sachs media conference. "We thought it would be much better to stay independent." A spokesman for News Corp. said it was no longer in talks with Telecom Italia.
