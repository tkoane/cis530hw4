Malone Keen To Build News Stake.
United States media tycoon John Malone has declared he will go on building Liberty Media's stake in News Corporation. His announcement came after the latest attempt to unwind a ban on Liberty's voting stake in News Corp broke down late last week. The chairman of US-based Liberty Media had been in talks with News Corp executive chairman Rupert Murdoch over how best to sell off Liberty's estimated 19 per cent stake in the worldwide media conglomerate. After Liberty quietly acquired the stake last year, Mr Murdoch enacted an emergency poison pill to make any attempted takeover prohibitively expensive. These discussions have occurred against the backdrop of the resignation of News Corps deputy chief operating officer Lachlan Murdoch. Mr Malone said late on Friday August 5, Liberty Media was comfortable with the status quo, and could look to raise its stake.
