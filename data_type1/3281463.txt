Liberty, News Corp. Talks Progress.
Liberty Media Corp. said on November 6 it has made progress in talks about swapping its stake in News Corp. for a stake in DirecTV or other assets owned by Rupert Murdoch's global media conglomerate. Liberty remains interested in acquiring News Corp.'s 38% stake in DirecTV Group Inc. or another asset on a tax-efficient basis, CEO Greg Maffei said. 'While I'm not sure where our negotiations with News will take us, one of the elements of a DirecTV deal that is appealing is the flexibility we would have,' Maffei told analysts during a conference call. Maffei believes Liberty could have a 'significant influence' on DirecTV by owning 38- 39% without taking 'hard control' of the satellite television provider.
