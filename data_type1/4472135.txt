Cadence Design Buyout Talks Halt.
The New York Times reported on June 18 that talks over a possible acquisition of Cadence Design Systems Inc. by two private equity firms have stalled over price. Cadence has held talks with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Blackstone Group, but discussions have been suspended, according to the report, which cited people close to the matter. Neither Blackstone or KKR nor Cadence immediately returned calls seeking comment. At $6.5 billion, Cadence may be too expensive for the firms, according to The Times, which first reported interest in a deal on June 4.
