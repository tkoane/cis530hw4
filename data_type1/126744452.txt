News Corp Reportedly Taps Allen & Co For MySpace Sale; JNJ Mobile Shows Interest.
News Corp. has tapped Allen & Company LLC to field buyout interest for MySpace, Inc. and has heard from about 50 parties, people familiar with the process told Reuters. One source close to the process said an auction for MySpace has not started yet. Justin Siegel, Chief Executive Officer of JNJ Mobile, Inc. said he was among the interested parties to have reached out to News Corp after News Corp signaled it may put MySpace on the block. Siegel expected to pay up to $200 million for MySpace, but admitted he was speculating. "I would be willing to hazard a guess the price is between $50 million - $200 million. They have not circulated the sales package yet," Siegel said in an interview. News Corp declined to comment to Reuters.
