ITV Reportedly 'Weeks Away' From Content Deal With Hulu.
ITV Plc is 'weeks away' from sealing a deal with Hulu LLC, to syndicate its content in exchange for equity in the company. Hulu, which is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., News Corporation and NBC Universal, Inc., has been in talks with all three but is the most advanced in its talks with ITV and expected to announce the terms of the arrangement within weeks. ITV is closest to signing a deal with Hulu which will have a level of exclusivity built into it. Hulu has been in talks with all the major British broadcasters but has made the most progress with ITV. It has offered each broadcaster the chance to take equity in the company in exchange for full-length program rights, said a source close to negotiations between the two parties. The final terms of commercial arrangements are still being hammered out, as ITV wanted to retain the rights to sell the adverts around its own content, but a compromise has been reached. Both ITV and Hulu were unavailable for comment.
