LUKOIL Interested In ConocoPhillips Assets.
LUKOIL Oil Company said that it will be the first in line to buy if partner ConocoPhillips was about to sell key assets. LUKOILs Chief Executive, Vagit Alekperov said, We are strategic partners (with Conoco) ... Today they are restructuring their assets and I hope that we would be among the first to know about (any sales) to study the need to take part in projects that Conoco will offer to the market. Conoco has said that it will keep the strategic stake but could sell pipelines, terminals and natural gas assets in North America as part of a $10 billion asset sale plan.
