Bids For News Corp Television Stations Due.
Final bids are due on November 16 for the nine television stations media conglomerate News Corp. put up for sale in June, two sources familiar with the situation said. Interest in the assets has come from private equity, those sources said, although it was unclear how many bidders would submit final offers. One source estimated that the assets could fetch bids in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said in June it retained Allen & Co. as adviser to sell nine of its Fox-affiliated television stations. Allen & Co. did not return a call for comment. News Corp. declined comment. The past few months have been tough to do deals amid turmoil in the debt markets, sparked by the sub prime loan crisis. Some broadcast deals have been put on hold or face being renegotiated or pulled.
