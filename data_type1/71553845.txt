Brocade Communications Reportedly Up For Sale.
The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation, that Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. has put itself up for sale. The report said that Oracle Corp and Hewlett-Packard Company were potential bidders for the company but a deal was not imminent and Brocade might not even go ahead with a sale. Brocade has been up for sale for a few weeks, the sources told Reuters. They said the process is still in early stages. One source described it as "feelers" rather than a formal process. It was also reported that HP has looked at Brocade's assets, but has not yet made a formal bid. That could be because HP is potentially interested in acquiring only certain components of Brocade, one source said. Spokesmen for Brocade and HP refused to comment, the report added. Brocade, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle were not available for comment, when contacted by Reuters.
