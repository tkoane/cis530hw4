Unipetrol Eyes ConocoPhillips' Refinery Stake.
Unipetrol said on November 21 that it remained strongly interested in raising its 51% stake in the Ceska Rafinerska refinery by buying out its partner ConocoPhillips. Unipetrol said in a statement it expected to have first refusal on the shareholding in the Ceska Rafinerska refinery, which Conoco has said might be sold to LUKOIL, in which it owns a 19% stake. We confirm our previous strong interest to increase our stake in Ceska Rafinerska, said Unipetrol. We trust that ConocoPhillips will make a preference offer to the other shareholders of Ceska Rafinerska following Rafinerska's articles of association, the company added. Unipetrol was responding to statements by ConocoPhillips chief James Mulva, who was quoted by Russian media last week as saying that ConocoPhillips considered LUKOIL to be the obvious buyer for its Czech refinery stake.
