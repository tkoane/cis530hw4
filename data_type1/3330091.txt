PTT Mulls Plan To Buy Conoco Petrol Stations.
PTT PCL said it was studying the possibility of buying ConocoPhillips service stations in the country. "We are studying information, which should take several months to conclude. It depends on pricing. If it's too expensive, we won't buy," PTT president Prasert Bunsumpun told reporters. There were other potential bidders, he said, but declined to say who they were and how much the final price may be. Newspapers in Thailand reported this week the deal was expected to be worth at least THB 3 billion ($82 million).
