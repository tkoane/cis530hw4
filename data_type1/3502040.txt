Rupert Murdoch Mulls Joining Chandler Family In Tribune Bid.
Rupert Murdoch is indeed considering stepping into the auction of Tribune Company. Mr. Murdoch, News Corporations chairman, told reporters at a news conference that he might join the Chandler family, the Tribunes largest shareholder, in a bid for the group. Mr. Murdoch said he was interested in joining the Chandler family in an offer that would give the group control of Tribunes 11 newspapers, including The Los Angeles Times and Newsday. According to Bloomberg News, he said that News Corporations interest would be limited to combining the printing and administrative functions of The New York Post, which it owns, with Newsdays, which is owned by Tribune. Were interested quite openly and frankly in doing something that could lead to a joint operating agreement, he said, adding that any move would entail a pretty small investment.
