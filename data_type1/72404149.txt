OpenGate, Zuckerman Reportedly Abandons Race To Acquire BusinessWeek.
OpenGate Capital and New York Daily News owner Mort Zuckerman have abandoned the race to acquire BusinessWeek owned by McGraw-Hill Cos Inc, people familiar with the matter said, leaving Bloomberg LP and ZelnickMedia LLC to vie for the magazine. OpenGate and Zuckerman could have lost interest because McGraw-Hill executives favor a sale to Bloomberg, the sources said. OpenGate had put in a bid for the magazine in September, along with Bloomberg and ZelnickMedia. Zuckerman came in with a last-minute bid, but dropped out a "few days ago," one of the sources told Reuters. McGraw-Hill had said in July it was considering "strategic options" for BusinessWeek, indicating it might sell the magazine. The company engaged Evercore Partners Inc to run the sale. A McGraw-Hill spokesman, Zelnick and OpenGate all refused to comment. A spokesman for Zuckerman was not available for comment.
