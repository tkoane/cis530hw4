Lukoil Denies Reports That It Is The Lead Contender To Acquire Whitegate.
Lukoil Oil Company has said reports that it is the lead contender to take over ConocoPhillips Whitegate oil refinery in Cork are wrong. A spokesperson from Lukoil said it would not comment any further. The Whitegate refinery in Cork harbor was put up for sale by ConocoPhillips in January. On July 24, Conoco was asked to comment on an update of the sale but failed to do so. Conoco expects to get between $400 million (300 million) and $500 million for the plant. Conoco plans to sell the refinery as an ongoing business that will continue to provide refined products into the Irish and other markets. According to reports, Lukoil is the lead contender but Topaz Energy Limited has sought information about Whitegate. Irving Oil Limited and Petroplus Holdings AG have both expressed an interest in acquiring the refinery.
