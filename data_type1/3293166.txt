News Corporation Says Not In Talks With CanWest Regarding Selling News Limited.
News Corporation said that it has no plans for de-merging its Australian newspapers and internet business. Since chair Lachlan Murdoch resigned from News Limited in 2005, there had been speculation that he was waiting for a "hiving off" of the enterprise before returning to the job. However, News CFO David DeVoe has rejected rumors the company is talking to CanWest about a sale. He also reiterated that News considers Australian TV assets overpriced and not worth acquiring at this point.
