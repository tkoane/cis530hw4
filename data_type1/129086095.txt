NextEra Energy Inc. is looking at acquiring a package of renewable energy assets that Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA (ACS) intends to divest, two people close to the matter said. ACSs renewable energy projects are worth about 4.6 billion. They include Spanish wind parks with capacity of 1,056MW, wind parks outside of Spain with 352MW of capacity and Spanish thermal solar plants with 349MW of capacity. The people stated that NextEra is keen to acquire both wind parks and solar thermal plants. The people added that NextEra would not make a decision on the acquisition until it gets funding for its first solar thermal project in Spain, which is to close in the coming weeks. ACS has divided the renewable assets into six packages according to type of asset, whether or not it is already in operation, and location. The company expects to receive binding offers in late April and expects to finalize some sales before the summer.
