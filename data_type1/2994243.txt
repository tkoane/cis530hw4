News Corp Interested in PCCWs Broadband Television Business.
News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch is interested in the broadband television business of PCCW but is also skeptical that Macquarie Bank's bid for the firm's phone and media assets can succeed. In an interview published on June 29th with The Australian newspaper, which he owns, Murdoch confirmed that News Corp held talks with Macquarie about key assets of PCCW, headed by Richard Li. However, Murdoch was skeptical about the Macquarie bid succeeding, saying he believes something had gone wrong in the bank's communications about its intentions with Beijing. 'Now they're treating Macquarie as hostile invaders,' he said. 'It would be an amazing achievement if Macquarie managed to turn the situation around.' One of the key issues in any sale has been what Beijing's position would be on the sale of strategic telecom assets to foreign parties. Murdoch told the newspaper that News Corp is interested in the 'video side of the business' and not the 'traditional telecom side' of PCCW.
