Lukoil Says It May Buy Shares In German Oil Refinery From Conoco.
Lukoil Oil Company is considering an offer from ConocoPhillips for Lukoil to buy shares in a Conoco oil refinery in Germany and help modernize the plant, a Lukoil spokesman said on April 3. The spokesman declined to name the refinery or to say how much could be spent on the project. "We're looking at the possibility of modernizing a refinery in Germany as a joint project" (with Conoco), the spokesman, Dmitry Dolgov, said. "We could also purchase shares in this refinery." Dolgov said the proposal had come from Conoco and was currently being evaluated by Lukoil.
