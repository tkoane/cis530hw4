ConocoPhillips In Talks With Buyers For Sale Of Refining Assets; Near-Term Deals Unlikely.
ConocoPhillips is holding discussions with potential buyers regarding the divesture of its refining assets. The company is unlikely to finalize a deal soon due to the current low valuations for refineries. Companys Vice President for investor relations, Clayton Reasor said: "We're working not only with other integrateds (major oil companies), but also with independent refiners about potential deals." He added: "By waiting a couple of years we think we'll improve the value we get for refinery sales." The company intends to divest $10 billion in assets over the next two years in order to reduce debt and steady its financial position.
