Murdoch Considers Talks With Planeta De Agostini Over Antena 3 Stake Buy.
News Corp is considering making a bid for De Agostini's stake in Antena 3 de Television SA, La Gaceta de los Negocios reported, citing unnamed sources close to the operation. Advisors to News Corp owner Rupert Murdoch are considering launching talks with the Italian publisher over the stake, it said. Analysts believe Spain's former prime minister Jose Maria Aznar, who is one of News Corp's advisors, is behind the rumored bid interest. De Agostini SA and Planeta Corp jointly own the Italian arm of Planeta, Grupo Planeta De Agostini SL, which will hold an around 43% stake in Antena 3.
