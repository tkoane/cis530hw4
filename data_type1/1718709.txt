Energi Mega Seeks Stake in ConocoPhillips, Exxon Field in Aceh.
PT Energi Mega Persada wants to buy a stake in a field owned by ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil Corp. ConocoPhillips is the operator of the field in the northwestern Indonesian province of Aceh. The field, which holds mainly gas deposits, hasn't been developed because the high carbon dioxide content makes it costly to operate. ConocoPhillips and Exxon have asked the Indonesian government for a higher share of revenue to make the field viable to operate. They are entitled to 40 percent of revenue and the government 60 percent. Indonesia wants natural gas from the field supplied to fertilizer makers in the province.
