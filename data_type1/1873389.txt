Conoco, LUKOIL Eye Joint Bid For Mazeikiu Nafta.
Oil majors LUKOIL and ConocoPhillips could join forces in a bid to buy Russian YUKOS's stake in Lithuanian refiner Mazeikiu Nafta. YUKOS paralysed by a Russian government claim for $27.5 billion in back taxes, has been in talks with a string of firms to sell its 53.7 percent stake in the Lithuanian firm. Under the current ownership deal, Lithuania has a say in any sale by YUKOS of its shares in the refinery which last year processed a record 8.66 million tonnes of crude and other feedstock.
