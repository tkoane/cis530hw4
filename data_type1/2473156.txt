Hilfiger Attracts Takeover Interest from Three Groups.
The auction for Tommy Hilfiger Corp. is headed into the home stretch this week, with three offers expected to be made by Friday. Several well-known apparel firms are circling the Hong Kong-based company with private-equity money playing a substantial role in the expected bids, according to people familiar with the matter. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. also is involved in the auction's final stages, seeking a licensing deal with the eventual winner, these people say. One of the expected bidders is an alliance of Apax Partners Ltd. and Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. Another is an alliance including Hong Kong's Li & Fung Ltd., Iconix Brand Group Inc. and investment firms Oak Hill Capital Partners LP and Perry Capital LLC. A third bidder is expected to be private-equity firm Sun Capital Partners Inc.
