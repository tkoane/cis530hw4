RTL Group Interested in Stake in Polsat.
RTL Group, a subsidiary of German media group Bertelsmann, is considering acquiring a stake in Telewizja Polsat. Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, the majority shareholder in Polsat, confirmed talks with RTL but said that discussions were underway with other investors. Alongside RTL, News Corp of Australia, BSkyB of the UK and TF1 of France are understood to be interested in a 20 per cent stake in Polsat. The stake up for sale has a market value of around 250m euros. It is hoped that selling the holding to an international investor will boost the value of Polsat ahead of its planned flotation next year. Analysts believe, however, that Polsat is also looking for a strategic investor to boost its position in Poland, where it has been losing market share over recent years.
