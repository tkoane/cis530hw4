News Corp. Not Interested in Facebook.
News Corp. isn't interested in buying Facebook, Ross Levinsohn, president of News Corp.'s Fox Interactive Media unit said. Levinsohn said that the buy would not make sense. Business Week had reported that Facebook is up for sale and wants as much as $2 billion. News Corp is trying to build Internet advertising sales by purchasing Web companies such as MySpace.com. Levinsohn also said that that Fox is in talks with potential search engine partners. A deal may be reached in the next two months, he said. Levinsohn declined to name any of the partners.
