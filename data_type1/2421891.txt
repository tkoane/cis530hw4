Majority Interest in Lithuania's Mazeikiai Oil Lures four Potential Buyers.
According to sources, a total of five companies aspire to acquire the majority holding in Mazeikiu Nafta from embattled Russia's oil company Yukos. Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank in charge of the sale procedure, has received four bids submitted by Kazakh oil and gas company KazMunayGaz, Poland's oil concern PKN Orlen, Russian-UK oil company TNK-BP and a consortium of Russia's and US oil majors Lukoil and ConocoPhillips. The bidders had to specify the price for a 53.7 percent in the sole Baltic oil refining and transportation complex in their tender offers. However, the bids are unbinding. Lehman Brothers will select three bidders, which will have to submit final tender offers.
