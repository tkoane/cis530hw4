News Corp in Talks for Turkish Media Firm.
News Corp. is in acquisition talks with the owners of Turkish broadcaster TGRT, an investment-banking source said on May 10th. Ihlas Holding, which owns news and entertainment broadcaster TGRT has said it is in negotiations with a U.S.-based group over a sale but has not given any other details. Turkish law only allows foreigners to own minority stakes in media companies, as a law aiming to allow full foreign ownership was scrapped last year. The source said a deal would likely be for a stake of around 25 percent.
