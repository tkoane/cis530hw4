Tommy Hilfiger Shares Down on Takeover Deal Doubts.
Shares of Tommy Hilfiger slid following a report that a deal to sell the company was in doubt. The New York Post reported that the bidding for the fashion brand, known for its preppy and American flag designs, has hit several obstacles, including the company's floundering U.S. business. Citing people involved in the talks, the article said there is disagreement between what Tommy Hilfiger is asking and what bidders are willing to offer, and concern over a possible licensing deal with discount behemoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Possible bidders include a team consisting of Apax Partners, Phillips-Van Heusen and Tommy Hilfiger's European partners; a group of Iconix Brand Group, Oak Hill Capital Partners and Perry Capital; and Sun Capital Partners, the report said.
