News Corp Reportedly Looking For New Adviser For European TV Sale.
News Corp. is quite close to appointing a new adviser for the sale of its broadcast properties in Latvia, Serbia and Bulgaria, people familiar with the matter said on September 22. News Corp. had appointed Lehman Brothers Inc to advice on the sale, but the fall of Lehman brother prompted the company to look for another advisor, the people said. Two people said JPMorgan was a favorite for the job of advisor, although one person said other banks were still in talks with News Corp. Before Lehman collapsed, other people had said second round bids for the assets were due in early October. It is not clear whether the appointment of a new adviser would change the timeframe for the sales process. The assets up for sale include Balkan News Corporation EAD, A/S Latvijas Neatkariga Televizija and Telewizja Puls Sp. z.o.o.
