Nine Firms Reportedly Eye BusinessWeek.
New York Post reported that The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. still has not set a date for suitors to submit offers for The BusinessWeek. The report added that nine companies are in the race, including OpenGate Capital, Warburg Pincus LLC, New York magazine owner, Bruce Wasserstein, Fast Company owner, Joe Mansueto and Platinum Equity, LLC. There is skepticism about McGraw-Hill's calculations for a price it would like for BusinessWeek. Observers said that Mr. Wasserstein is emerging as a front-runner for the title. There is no guarantee Wasserstein will step up and buy the magazine. New York Post reported, After spending $65 million in 2004 for New York and burning through several million ever since, sources said he might only buy BusinessWeek if he can be convinced the title could regain some of its former glory. That might include getting as close to the $100 million in profits it generated a decade ago. Today, BusinessWeek is losing tens of millions of dollars.
