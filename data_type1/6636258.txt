AES Reportedly Invites Nine Firms To Bid For Four Plants.
The AES Corporation is known to be inviting up to nine companies to bid for four power plants by May 25. The company intends to finalize the sale by August, contractors close to the sale stated. The company is understood to be selling its stakes in two plants in Pakistan, one in Jordan and one in Oman, which are collectively valued at $1.5 billion. The company had earlier stated that it intended to divest the plants as a single package. However, contractors indicated that it now plans to sell the power plants individually. Sources close to the development stated that AES will impose an "aggressive" timeline for concluding the sale in order to finalize the sale by August. A source stated: "There has been significant interest in all four assets, including the plants in Pakistan. The plan is to maximize the sale price by allowing bidders to bid for whatever parts of the portfolio they see as being most attractive." AES owns 60% stakes in the Barka I power plant (AES Barka SAOG) and the Al-Manakher Amman East pla
