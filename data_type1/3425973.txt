New York Times Says Boston Globe Important Asset.
The New York Times Co. on January 18th reaffirmed its commitment to The Boston Globe, calling the newspaper an important asset on a "good course", following reports that a group of businessmen want to buy it. "The Boston Globe is an extremely important asset and it is on a good course," New York Times Chief Executive Officer Janet Robinson told reporters after a speech in Boston. "We are very pleased with this asset and we truly consider it an asset." Three months ago, however, a trio of Boston businessmen including retired General Electric Co. chief Jack Welch approached The New York Times media group to obtain exclusive rights to negotiate a sale of the Globe.
