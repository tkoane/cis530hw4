Telstra May Sell Foxtel Stake To Partners.
It was reported that Foxtel partners would benefit as Telstra Corporation Limited is likely to be forced to look at selling half of its stake in FOXTEL Cable Television Pty Limited. Shares in Consolidated Media Holdings Ltd. and News Corp - which each own a 25% stake in Foxtel - advanced amid rumors they could end up with Telstra's stake in FOXTEL. The Australian government had urged Telstra to split its wholesale network and retail businesses into two separate companies to boost competition in Australia's telecommunications sector. It was reported that if the company chooses not to split, it will face functional separation and will be barred from acquiring more valuable wireless spectrum - key to the company's growth - while it still owns the stake in Foxtel.
