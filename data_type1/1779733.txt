News Corp In Talks To Buy Russian Ren TV Stake.
According to sources, the owners of Severstal Group are in talks to sell some of their 70% stake in TV channel Ren TV to News Corp. Bertelsmann AG unit RTL and Severstal Group, headed by Kremlin-loyal Alexei Mordashov, agreed to buy out the two shareholders of Ren TV, one of Russia's few remaining national TV channels not directly or indirectly controlled by the state, a month ago. Under the deal, Severstal Group took 70% and RTL took 30%. Reports have since circulated that RTL wants to increase its stake to 49%. The person close to the matter said News Corp. is seeking a stake of up to 35%, but that the Severstal Group hasn't yet made any decisions about what to do with its shares.
