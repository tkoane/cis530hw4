Six Firms Interested in Lyondell-Citgo Refinery.
Six contenders have come forward as potentially serious bidders for a Houston refinery jointly owned by Lyondell Chemical Corp. and Venezuela's state-owned oil company, two people familiar with the negotiations said. Petroleos de Venezuela SA and Houston-based Lyondell put the 268,000-barrel-a-day plant up for sale in April after deciding to end an acrimonious partnership. PdVSA co-owns the refinery - the first of its scale to come on the auction block in years - through its Citgo Petroleum Corp. unit. Analysts have estimated the refinery could fetch as much as $5 billion. Possible buyers for the plant, which specializes in processing heavy crude, include Canada's Husky Energy Inc. and ConocoPhillips, the two people said. A Husky representative couldn't immediately be reached for comment, and ConocoPhillips has repeatedly declined to comment on the sale. Tesoro Corp. has said in the past that it's looking at the refinery.
