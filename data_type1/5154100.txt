AK Steel Eyes Sparrows Point.
According to a memo sent to workers of Sparrows Point steel mill, representatives from AK Steel Holding Corp were set to tour the factory on February 4. AK Steel did not return telephone calls yesterday seeking comment about whether it is considering a bid for the steel mill or to confirm if representatives had visited the plant. Several workers confirmed that visitors toured the plant. Regulators are requiring that owner Arcelor Mittal to sell the Sparrows Point plant to settle antitrust issues over tin plate production. The plant has not attracted many suitors from the United States. Most of the companies that previously bid were from Latin America and Europe.
