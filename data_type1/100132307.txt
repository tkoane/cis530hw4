KKR, CVC May Reportedly Team Up To Bid For IDC.
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) and CVC Capital Partners Ltd. might have teamed up to bid for Interactive Data Corporation (IDC), two sources familiar with the matter said. IDC said in January that it was reviewing its strategic options, which prompted interest from a number of private equity firms. Sources previously told Reuters that other teams that paired up include Advent International S.r.l with Bain Capital, LLC; and Hellman & Friedman LLC with Silver Lake Partners. The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. is still in the process, one source said. It is unclear how much interest there is from other strategic bidders at this point. A deadline for the next round of bids has not yet been set, but could come in mid-April, the source said. Reuters reported that KKR, CVC, Bain, Pearson, McGraw-Hill and IDC declined comment. H&F, Silver Lake and Advent could not be reached for comment.
