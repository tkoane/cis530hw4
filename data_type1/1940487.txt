ConocoPhillips says still in race to buy Mazeikiu.
ConocoPhillips said it was still in the race to buy Lithuanian refinery Mazeikiu Nafta and that it was confident it would acquire the asset despite stiff competition. Russian oil company YUKOS is poised to sell its controlling 53.7 percent stake in the Baltic region's only refining complex and is believed to want $1 billion for it. The Lithuanian state has a 40.6 percent stake and a final say on who the buyer will be. ConocoPhillips Chairman James Mulva, in Vilnius to meet state officials, said his company had a "compelling argument" that would help it win the battle to buy Mazeikiu, which has attracted interest from over half a dozen oil groups.
