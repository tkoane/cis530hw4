Conoco to Spend $2.5 Billion - $3 Billion To Up Lukoil Stake.
ConocoPhillips plans to spend $2.5 billion - $3 billion on raising its stake in Lukoil to 20 percent by end-2006, CEO James Mulva said in an interview published on March 21st. Conoco has close to 17 percent of Lukoil. Mulva said Conoco had already invested $6 billion in Russia including the purchase of its existing stake in Lukoil, a deal that gives it access to massive untapped Arctic fields and allows it to book almost a billion barrels of new reserves. Under the deal with Lukoil, Conoco may boost its stake to a maximum 20 percent, which it is doing ahead of schedule. Conoco had said previously that it may take between two and three years to raise the stake to 20 percent.
