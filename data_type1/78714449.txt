ConocoPhillips Has No Plans To Sell Stake In Lukoil.
Vagit Alekperov, the head and co-owner of LUKOIL Oil Company said on October 19, that ConocoPhillips has no plans to sell its stake in LUKOIL so far. "I met ConocoPhillips' President last week and we have discussed the issue... Neither the board of directors (of Conoco) nor the management have so far considered selling the stake," Interfax agency quoted him as saying. Conoco had said earlier in October that it would cut its 2010 capital budget by 12% and sell off assets worth $10 billion in the next few years to improve its financial position. Conoco's statement has sparked rumors regarding the assets it could sell and analysts said it could sell half its stake in LUKOIL.
