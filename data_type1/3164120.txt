News Corp Says No Stake Talks With Telecom Italia.
News Corp. Inc. on September 12th said that it still has no plans to buy a stake in Telecom Italia SpA, which plans to split its fixed network business from its mobile wireless division to focus on broadband and media. On September 11th, Telecom Italia announced a deal to carry News Corp.'s Fox films on its broadband service Alice Home TV, as the Italian press continued to speculate about an equity tie- up, despite News Corp.'s repeated denials. "I would say that, not necessarily forever, but there is no possibility we'd purchase a stake in Telecom Italia," Peter Chernin, chief operating officer of News Corp., told investors at the Merrill Lynch media conference. "It's not something we're doing, it's not something we're talking about." News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch dismissed rumors the company was in talks for a stake in Telecom Italia, when asked by analysts and reporters on a conference call in August.
