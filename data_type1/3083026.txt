Italy May Allow News Corp Telecom Italia Stake Buy If Network Sold To CDP.
The Italian government may allow News Corp to buy a stake in Telecom Italia SpA if the telecom operator transfers the ownership of its network to state-owned financial group Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA (CDP), daily Corriere della Sera said in an unsourced report. The sale of the network to CDP would allow Telecom Italia to cut its debt as well as soften political opposition towards the entry of a foreign shareholder in the telecom operator, the paper said. Despite a recent denial from Telecom Italia, the newspaper said there is a plan under which Telecom Italia would buy News Corp's Italian satellite TV unit Sky Italia in exchange for a significant stake in Telecom Italia's main shareholder Olimpia.
