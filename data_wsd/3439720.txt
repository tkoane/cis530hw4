Lachlan Murdoch Might Bid For Ten.
Speculation is building that son Lachlan Murdoch will bid for the Ten television network. The network has been officially up for sale since December when CanWest and the Ten Group itself announced that they would consider bids for the entire company. The sale price is expected to exceed $4billion. Last week the Ten Group issued an information memorandum to likely bidders including the Macquarie Media Group, News Corporation, WIN Television and, it is believed, Lachlan Murdoch's company, Illyria Pty Ltd.
