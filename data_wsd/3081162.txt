Shaw Brothers Confirm Sale Plans For TVB.
Television Broadcasts Ltd. (TVB) controlling shareholder, Shaw Brothers (Hong Kong) Ltd., has confirmed recent media reports that Shaw is looking to sell its interest in TVB to a consortium of bidders. A list of potential companies is currently being reviewed and one of the top names rumored to be interested in the stake is China Central Television (CCTV). However, no confirmation of a deal has been given yet and CCTV is not the only company that media reports have named as a potential suitor. Other reports have also speculated with big names such as Hong Kong's wealthiest man Li Ka-shing and Chan Kwok Keung of ITC Corp. Ltd., as well as News Corp. and Astro All Asia Networks PLC. Of late, Shaw Brothers' 99-year-old founder Sir Run Run Shaw has been in ill health, fueling talks that the TVB stake will be sold soon. TVB, which reported HKD 4.18 billion in revenue last year, is seen as a worthy buy.
